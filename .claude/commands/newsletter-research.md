# newsletter-research

The system should:

- Analyze what's trending across multiple newsletters
- Analyze my newsletter from the link in my files
- Analyze the newsletters from my competitors in the links in my files
- Create ready-to-send drafts, not just outlines
- Make subject lines that create curiosity

Focus on value-first content that sounds authentic, not AI-generated.

Steps:

- Read newsletter URLs from my files newsletter/newsletter links.md
- Fetches recent posts from those newsletters
- For the paid publications, I do have the paid plan so ask me to provide this if required
- Launches a content-researcher subagent to find trends
- Then launches a newsletter-writer subagent to create a draft
- Saves research and draft to organized folders
