# Enhanced Post Management System

## Overview

The video summarizer system has been completely refactored to eliminate data duplication between `output/processed_posts.json` and `found_urls_*.md` files, while adding powerful filtering and batch processing capabilities.

## 🎯 Problems Solved

### Before (Issues)
- ❌ **Data duplication**: Same post info stored in both JSON and markdown files
- ❌ **Manual processing**: Copying URLs from markdown files for processing
- ❌ **No filtering**: Couldn't easily process posts by date, source, or criteria
- ❌ **Inefficient workflow**: Multiple steps to identify and process interesting posts
- ❌ **Redundant files**: `found_urls_*.md` files cluttering the directory

### After (Solutions)
- ✅ **Single source of truth**: All data in enhanced `output/processed_posts.json`
- ✅ **Powerful filtering**: Query by status, date, source, platform
- ✅ **Batch processing**: Process multiple posts with one command
- ✅ **Flexible workflows**: Easy to process posts based on any criteria
- ✅ **Clean organization**: No redundant markdown files

## 🔧 New Tools

### 1. Enhanced Post Manager (`scripts/post_manager.py`)

**Core functionality:**
```bash
# List posts with filtering
python3 scripts/post_manager.py list --status=discovered --source=stratechery --limit=5

# Process specific posts
python3 scripts/post_manager.py process post_id1 post_id2 post_id3

# Bulk operations
python3 scripts/post_manager.py bulk --status=discovered --action=process --limit=10

# Update post status
python3 scripts/post_manager.py update post_id1 post_id2 --status=skipped

# Get statistics
python3 scripts/post_manager.py stats
```

**Advanced filtering examples:**
```bash
# Posts from last week
python3 scripts/post_manager.py list --since=2025-09-25

# Only RSS feed posts
python3 scripts/post_manager.py list --platform=rss_feed

# Lenny's Newsletter posts only
python3 scripts/post_manager.py list --source=lennysnewsletter

# Export URLs for external processing
python3 scripts/post_manager.py list --source=stratechery --format=urls
```

### 2. Quick Process Script (`scripts/quick_process.sh`)

**Simplified commands for daily use:**
```bash
# Quick check of recent posts
./scripts/quick_process.sh check

# Show statistics
./scripts/quick_process.sh stats

# Process first 3 discovered posts
./scripts/quick_process.sh process 3

# Show posts by source
./scripts/quick_process.sh stratechery
./scripts/quick_process.sh lenny
./scripts/quick_process.sh claude

# Get URLs for external processing
./scripts/quick_process.sh urls stratechery

# Bulk process posts
./scripts/quick_process.sh bulk 5
```

### 3. Legacy Migration Tool ~~(`scripts/migrate_legacy_urls.py`)~~

**✅ COMPLETED - Migration tool has been removed after successful completion:**
- All legacy markdown files (`found_urls_*.md`) were successfully migrated to JSON format
- The migration tool has been removed as it's no longer needed
- All URLs now use normalized base URLs to prevent duplicates

## 📊 Enhanced Data Structure

### New JSON Schema
```json
{
  "post_id": {
    "title": "Article Title",
    "url": "https://...",
    "platform": "rss_feed|generic",
    "source_feed": "https://...",
    "published_date": "2025-10-02T10:00:00",
    "found_at": "2025-10-02T10:01:17.855185",
    "status": "discovered|processing|completed|failed|skipped|queued",
    "processed_at": null,
    "summary_file": null,
    "tags": [],
    "priority": "medium"
  }
}
```

### Status Lifecycle
1. **discovered** - Found by daily checker, ready for review
2. **queued** - Marked for processing
3. **processing** - Currently being processed
4. **completed** - Successfully processed with summary
5. **failed** - Processing failed (can retry)
6. **skipped** - Manually skipped (not interesting)

## 🚀 Updated Workflow

### Manual Post Discovery
```bash
# Run manual checker (no more markdown files generated)
./manual_check.sh

# Output shows summary and suggests management commands
```

### Processing Posts
```bash
# Quick check what's new
./scripts/quick_process.sh check

# Process interesting ones
./scripts/quick_process.sh process 3

# Or filter by source
./scripts/quick_process.sh stratechery
python3 scripts/post_manager.py process 59ac0a6d 3fb6a41c

# Bulk process if many good posts
./scripts/quick_process.sh bulk 10
```

### Advanced Filtering Workflows
```bash
# Process all recent Stratechery posts
python3 scripts/post_manager.py bulk --source=stratechery --action=process --limit=5

# Skip all Creator Economy posts for now
python3 scripts/post_manager.py bulk --source=creatoreconomy --action=skip --limit=20

# Get URLs for external tools
python3 scripts/post_manager.py list --since=2025-10-01 --format=urls > recent_urls.txt
```
